# todoList

This purpose of this project was to create a work scheudle or to-do list to save things on the hour that need to be accomplished.

For future hours, the rows would be green, for the current hour the row would be red and for the past the rows would be grey.

When the participant would write within the rows and click the save button the todo written would be saved and stay with that date and current time even if the page was refreshed.

I was able to get the colors working for the hours, post the current date and time at the top of the screen but unable to have the info stay on the page if refreshed.

it would show what i typed in localStorage when i checked it on the console.log but not stay on the page.
I tried to adjust the getItem to just hour as well as set every hours to the simialr localStorage but that did not work either.
